# StableBank

**A decentralized savings protocol on Solana.**
> Deposit SOL. We stake it. You earn. No banks. No middlemen.

---

## The Idea

Traditional banks take your money, lend it out at 10–20%, and pay you back 0.5%.
StableBank flips that. Your SOL gets staked on existing Solana protocols — you keep the yield.

No LP. No trading. No complexity.
Just **deposit → stake → earn.**

---

## How It Works

```
User sends SOL to StableBank
           |
           v
StableBank stakes it natively on Solana
           |
           v
Staking yield accumulates (6–9% APY)
           |
           v
User earns yield on their balance
           |
           v
User withdraws SOL + earnings anytime
```

StableBank is the savings account that banks never gave you.

---

## Onramp / Offramp

StableBank is designed so that anyone — even without crypto knowledge — can use it.
No wallet setup. No SOL required upfront. Just savings that earn.

```
ONRAMP
User has Naira / USD
           |
           v
Pay via bank transfer, card, or mobile money
(Transak / Flutterwave)
           |
           v
SOL purchased automatically
           |
           v
SOL deposited into StableBank and starts earning

OFFRAMP
User wants to withdraw earnings
           |
           v
StableBank unstakes SOL
           |
           v
SOL converts to USDC via Jupiter swap
           |
           v
Transak / Flutterwave converts USDC to Naira / USD
           |
           v
Lands in user bank account
```

Onramp / Offramp providers:

| Provider | Coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Transak | Nigeria, 150+ countries | Naira + bank transfer support |
| Flutterwave | Nigeria first | Local bank transfer, cards |
| MoonPay | Global | Card payments |
| Onramp.money | Solana native | Direct SOL onramp |

---

## Staking Backends

StableBank does not build staking from scratch.
It sits on top of existing, battle-tested Solana staking protocols:

| Protocol | Type | Est. Yield |
|---|---|---|
| Native Solana Staking | Validator delegation | ~6-7% APY |
| Marinade Finance | Liquid Staking | ~7% APY |
| Jito | Liquid Staking + MEV | ~8-9% APY |
| Sanctum | LST Infrastructure | Varies |

StableBank routes deposits to these protocols and passes yield back to users minus a small protocol fee.

---

## Yield Aggregator (Phase 2)

StableBank will automatically route SOL to whichever protocol offers the best yield at any given time.

```
User deposits SOL
           |
           v
Aggregator checks all protocols in real time
Native: 6-7% | Marinade: 7% | Jito: 8-9% | Kamino: 10%+
           |
           v
SOL routed to best yield automatically
           |
           v
User always earns maximum available APY
```

---

## Agentic Yield Optimization (Phase 2)

An autonomous agent monitors yields 24/7 and rebalances deposits when better opportunities arise.
No human input required — the agent handles everything.

```
Agent monitors all protocol yields every epoch
           |
           v
Detects better opportunity
(e.g. Jito yield > Native by 1%)
           |
           v
Agent triggers rebalance automatically
           |
           v
SOL moves to higher yield protocol
           |
           v
User earns better yield without doing anything
```

When Phase 3 goes on-chain, the agent becomes a **crank** — an off-chain bot that triggers
on-chain rebalancing instructions through the Pinocchio program.

## Architecture

### Option A — Off-Chain (Phase 1, Complete)
A backend server holds a custodial wallet, receives user SOL, stakes natively on Solana, and tracks balances in a database.

- Cheapest to build, no deployment costs, ship fast
- Custodial — users trust you with their SOL
- Best for: personal testing and close circle of users

### Option B — Aggregator + Agent (Phase 2, Now)
Backend integrates multiple staking protocols. An autonomous agent monitors yields and rebalances automatically. Onramp/offramp added for Naira users.

- Still off-chain, no smart contract needed yet
- Agent handles yield optimization without human input
- Best for: expanding to more users with better yield

### Option C — Hybrid (Phase 3)
A lightweight Pinocchio program handles deposits and withdrawals. Backend agent triggers on-chain rebalancing as a crank.

- Partially trustless, lower cost than fully on-chain
- Best for: small public beta with real trust guarantees

### Option D — Fully On-Chain (Phase 4)
Everything lives in a Solana program. Non-custodial. Users always control their funds.

- Fully trustless, production-grade
- Best for: full public launch

> Current stage: Phase 2

## Risks & Honesty

- Phase 1 and 2 are custodial. Early users are trusting you personally, not a smart contract. Be transparent about this.
- Staking protocols carry risk. Battle-tested but not risk-free.
- Slashing risk is near zero on Solana but worth monitoring.
- Agent rebalancing introduces execution risk — bad timing can cost fees. Thresholds are in place to only rebalance when yield difference justifies the cost.
- Regulatory landscape around crypto savings products is evolving. Build responsibly.
